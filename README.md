# onlinesoppa

This project aims to build a home page that will help our fraternity handle signups for our soup events. These events have for a long time been handled via Facebook which has proven to be a less than optimal solution.

The home page consists of both an front-end and an back-end, both which are developed by students. 

The project is driven as an effort to achieve an real world application of skills aquired through university studies.
